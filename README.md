## Readiness

The author of this package is in the process of setting up this
package for optimal usability. The following has already been completed:

- [ ] Documentation
    - A package description has been written in the README
    - Documentation has been generated using `make docs`, committed,
        and pushed to GitHub.
	- GitHub pages have been setup in the project settings
	  with the "source" set to "master branch /docs folder".
- [ ] An initial release
	- In `CHANGELOG.md`, a release date has been added to v0.1.0 (change the YYYY-MM-DD).
	- The release has been marked a release on GitHub.
	- For more info, see the [Software Release Guide](https://cicwi.github.io/software-guides/software-release-guide).
- [ ] A conda package
    - Required packages have been added to `setup.py`, for instance,
      ```
      requirements = [
          # Add your project's requirements here, e.g.,
          # 'astra-toolbox',
          # 'sacred>=0.7.2',
          # 'tables==3.4.4',
      ]
      ```
      has been replaced by
      ```
      requirements = [
          'astra-toolbox',
          'sacred>=0.7.2',
          'tables==3.4.4',
      ]
      ```
    - All "conda channels" that are required for building and
      installing the package have been added to the
      `Makefile`. Specifically, replace
      ```
      conda_package:
        conda install conda-build -y
        conda build conda/
      ```
      by
      ```
      conda_package:
        conda install conda-build -y
        conda build conda/ -c some-channel -c some-other-channel
      ```
    - Conda packages have been built successfully with `make conda_package`.
    - These conda packages have been uploaded to
      [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org). [This](http://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda-cloud/user-guide/getting-started/#cloud-getting-started-build-upload)
      is a good getting started guide.
    - The installation instructions (below) have been updated. Do not
      forget to add the required channels, e.g., `-c some-channel -c
      some-other-channel`, and your own channel, e.g., `-c ahendriksen`.


## Getting Started

It takes a few steps to setup On the fly machine learning for improving image resolution in tomography on your
machine. We recommend installing
